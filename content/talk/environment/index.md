TL;DR

- Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) on your computer.
- Install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com) on your computer.
- Install `devtools` as `r install.packages("devtools")`
- Install packages for class from Github (`r devtools::source_url("")`)



## Getting Set Up

Here are the [slides](/slides/environment.html) for the basic setup.  The video below goes through these slides and shows you how to get your computer set up.

There are really nice tutorials on how to install both R and RStudio on those sites tailored for your particular platform.  If you run into a problem, please email [me](mailto:rjdyer@vcu.edu&subject=Install-Problem).


### Online

You can work with R and RStudio entirely online if you like.  To do this, go to [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and create a free account.  This will run the RStudio GUI as a server instance that you can reach through any web interface you like.  This is *very convienent* though is not something you can rely upon for all your work.  While RStudio is currently giving this away as a free service, it may not last forever. 

## R & RStudio 



### Packages

One of the main benefits of `R` is that there is a ton of community contributed code that we can use in our own analyses.  This code comes in the form of packages that extend the base functionality of `R`.  The video below highlights some of ways in which we interact with packages in `R` and how to downlaod and install the set of packages that we will be using in this class.

### RStudio 


Another *huge* benefit is RStudio which is a full featured IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that helps you effectively write good code.  The video below covers some of the highlights of the RStudio development environment from its developers.
