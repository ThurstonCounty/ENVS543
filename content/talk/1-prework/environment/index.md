abstract: This talk will focus on getting you and your computer ready for the semester.  There are some applications that you'll need to download and install on your computer *before* we start class.  We will also need to install some packages in `R` that have all the data sets and other content that we use in the class so you will be ready.

## Setting Up the R Environment

The R statistical programming language is an open source project supported by an international community of indiviudals.


### On Your Computer

To get your computer set up you need to download and install two things:  
 - `R` from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org), and 
 - `RStudio` from [rstudio.org](https://rstudio.org).
 
R is the basic runtime and a rudimentary system for interacting with the language interpreter.  RStudio is the main interface through which we will be operating with the `R` environemnt.  It is a full-fledged graphical user interface and makes your life suck *a lot less*!  

There are really nice tutorials on how to install both R and RStudio on those sites tailored for your particular platform.  If you run into a problem, please email [me](mailto:rjdyer@vcu.edu&subject=Install-Problem).


### Online

You can work with R and RStudio entirely online if you like.  To do this, go to [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and create a free account.  This will run the RStudio GUI as a server instance that you can reach through any web interface you like.  This is *very convienent* though is not something you can rely upon for all your work.  While RStudio is currently giving this away as a free service, it may not last forever.
