### Content

This topic has slides, a video presentation of the slides, and a self-paced quiz to see if you've learned the general content.  These items are not graded and are here for your background benefit.  However, I will assume you have already gone through the slides, watched the most-awesome presentation on numerical data types you've seen to date, and taken a shot at the quiz.  


#### Presentation 

Here is a video of me going over the slides and discussing numerical data types.
