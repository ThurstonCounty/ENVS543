abstract: "This set of talks will focus on the four primary types of data we will use in R: (*numerical*, *character*, *logical*, and *factors* ).  In these activities you will gain a basic understanding of how to initiate, coerce, convert, and perform basic operations with each type of data in the most common contexts they will be found in this class."

## Content

This lecture group has slides, video presentations, and a self-paced quiz to see if you've learned the general content presented about general data types.  I will assume you have already gone through the slides, watched the most-awesome presentation on data types you've seen to date in this class, and taken a shot at the quiz on each topic.  

If you have any questions on something in the presentation, there is a [link at the end of the slides](https://forms.gle/gRVvdC3DhhCnRoJ17) to send me a question and I'll do my best to either get back to you or post the answer on the class website.


### Data Types



#### Numerical Data
