title: Course Overview
---

This is a 3-credit introductory data course required for all Environmental Studies Students entering our gradaute program.  This course is taught as a pseudo-flipped course.  This site serves as the main source of content with lectures, videos, documents, and homework.  The general categories covered in this class include:

 - *Visualization* – How do we visualize univariate, bivariate, and spatial data?
 - *Data Manipulation* – The vast majority of time spent conducting data analysis is focused on pre-configuring and cleaning up data and preparing it for anlaysis.  Topics in this section will focus on raw data manipulation. 
 - *Models* – The application of statistical models to our data allows us to gain inferences into underlying processes.  Topics here focus the performing specific statistical processes and communicating their results.

Students must go over the content for any particular class before we meet, there is a lot of background that you need to bring to each session.  To effectively develop skills in data analysis using R or any other language, you must actually use it.  It is ineffective for you to sit an listen to a lecture in class, you should be typing on your computer and working with real data!
