*Enviroinmental Data Literacy* is the first course in a sequence of classes for graduate students (and in some cases upper-level undergradaute students) in Environmental Studies, Ecology, and Evolution at Virginia Commonwealth University.  During this semester you will be introduced to the process of acquiring, manipulation, visualizing, analyzing, and communicating about ecolgoical and geospatial data using the `R` statistical programming language.  As an applied scientist, these will be some of the most important skills that you will develop in graduate school.

To begin, you will need to set up your computing environment and dip your toes into `R`.  If you already know a little (or a lot) of `R`, you can skim the following items.  However, if you are new to data analysis in R, you *must* go through all the material below.  I am assuming that you will be able to perform all the operations discussed in the preliminary talks listed below.  If not, you will start the class in a deficitâ€”not where we would like to be.

    <a href="talk/environment/">Setting up the R Environment.</a>
  </h3>
  <div class="article-style">
  <p>This talk will focus on getting you and your computer ready for the semester.  There are some applications that you'll need to download and install on your computer *before* we start class.  We will also need to install some packages in `R` that have all the data sets and other content that we use in the class so you will be ready.</p>

    <a href="talk/data_types/">Data Types in R.</a>
  </h3>
  <div class="article-style">
  <p>This set of talks will focus on the four primary types of data we will use in R: (*numerical*, *character*, *logical*, and *factors* ).  In these activities you will gain a basic understanding of how to initiate, coerce, convert, and perform basic operations with each type of data in the most common contexts they will be found in this class.</p>

    <a href="talk/data_containers/">Data Containers.</a>
  </h3>
  <div class="article-style">
  <p>These short talks will cover three of the more commonly used data containers in `R`: `data.frame`, `list`, and `matrix`.  Here we will cover how to create these structures *de novo* as well as load content from files, the internet, or a database.</p>
