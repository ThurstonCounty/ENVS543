*Enviroinmental Data Literacy* is the first course in a sequence of classes for graduate students (and in some cases upper-level undergradaute students) in Environmental Studies, Ecology, and Evolution at Virginia Commonwealth University.  During this semester you will be introduced to the process of acquiring, manipulation, visualizing, analyzing, and communicating about ecolgoical and geospatial data using the `R` statistical programming language.  As an applied scientist, these will be some of the most important skills that you will develop in graduate school.

To begin, you will need to set up your computing environment and dip your toes into `R`.  If you already know a little (or a lot) of `R`, you can skim the following items.  However, if you are new to data analysis in R, you *must* go through all the material below.  I am assuming that you will be able to perform all the operations discussed in the preliminary talks listed below.  If not, you will start the class in a deficitâ€”not where we would like to be.

## Setting Up the R Environment

The R statistical programming language is an open source project supported by an international community of indiviudals.


### On Your Computer

To get your computer set up you need to download and install two things:  
 - `R` from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org), and 
 - `RStudio` from [rstudio.org](https://rstudio.org).
 
R is the basic runtime and a rudimentary system for interacting with the language interpreter.  RStudio is the main interface through which we will be operating with the `R` environemnt.  It is a full-fledged graphical user interface and makes your life suck *a lot less*!  

There are really nice tutorials on how to install both R and RStudio on those sites tailored for your particular platform.  If you run into a problem, please email [me](mailto:rjdyer@vcu.edu&subject=Install-Problem).


### Online

You can work with R and RStudio entirely online if you like.  To do this, go to [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and create a free account.  This will run the RStudio GUI as a server instance that you can reach through any web interface you like.  This is *very convienent* though is not something you can rely upon for all your work.  While RStudio is currently giving this away as a free service, it may not last forever.
