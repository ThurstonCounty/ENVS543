Quick overview video\n  R is engine and RStudio is dashboard. \u0026ldquo;modern dive\u0026rdquo; Download R \u0026amp; RStudio  R is the basic runtime and a rudimentary system for interacting with the language interpreter. RStudio is the main interface through which we will be operating with the R environemnt. It is a full-fledged graphical user interface and makes your life suck a lot less!\n Install RStudio from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo.\nThere are really nice tutorials on how to install both R and RStudio on those sites tailored for your particular platform. If you run into a problem, please email me.\nOnline You can work with R and RStudio entirely online if you like. To do this, go to rstudio.cloud and create a free account. This will run the RStudio GUI as a server instance that you can reach through any web interface you like. This is very convienent though is not something you can rely upon for all your work. While RStudio is currently giving this away as a free service, it may not last forever.\nR \u0026amp; RStudio Packages One of the main benefits of R is that there is a ton of community contributed code that we can use in our own analyses. This code comes in the form of packages that extend the base functionality of R. The video below highlights some of ways in which we interact with packages in R and how to downlaod and install the set of packages that we will be using in this class.\n INSERT VIDEO OF R PACKAGES \u0026amp; DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CLASS\n RStudio Another huge benefit is RStudio which is a full featured IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that helps you effectively write good code. The video below covers some of the highlights of the RStudio development environment from its developers.\n RStudio Overview - 1:30 from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo.\nProjects in R Given the broad applicability of R for data analysis and reproducibility\n INSERT SHORT TALK HERE ABOUT USING PROJECTS IN RSTUDIO\n  Create new Project for Class Close RStudio Click on *.proj to open up.

This course is taught as a pseudo-flipped course. This site serves as the main source of content with lectures, videos, documents, and homework. The general categories covered in this class include:\n Visualization – How do we visualize univariate, bivariate, and spatial data? Data Manipulation – The vast majority of time spent conducting data analysis is focused on pre-configuring and cleaning up data and preparing it for anlaysis. Topics in this section will focus on raw data manipulation. Models – The application of statistical models to our data allows us to gain inferences into underlying processes. Topics here focus the performing specific statistical processes and communicating their results.  Students must go over the content for any particular class before we meet, there is a lot of background that you need to bring to each session. To effectively develop skills in data analysis using R or any other language, you must actually use it. It is ineffective for you to sit an listen to a lecture in class, you should be typing on your computer and working with real data!\nSchedule of Content The order and timing of each topic covered in this class is listed below as are quick links to the homework assignments associated with each week.\n   Date Content Section Topic Homework Interactives     10 Aug Visualization Markdown \u0026amp; Notebooks HW 1  Slides Lecture   17 Aug Visualization GGPlot2 HW 2  Slides Lecture   24 Aug Visualization Spatial Data HW 3  Slides Lecture   31 Aug Visualization Rasters HW 4  Slides Lecture   7 Sep Visualization Interactive Graphics HW 5  Slides Lecture   14 Sep Data Manipulation Character \u0026amp; Factor Data HW 6  Slides Lecture   21 Sep Data Manipulation Tidyverse I HW 7  Slides Lecture   28 Sep Data Manipulation Tidyverse II HW 8  Slides Lecture   5 Oct Data Manipulation Functions \u0026amp; Iteration HW 9  Slides Lecture   12 Oct Data Manipulation Database HW 10 Slides Lecture   19 Oct Models Ordination \u0026amp; Tree-based Processes HW 11 Slides Lecture   26 Oct Models Correlation \u0026amp; Regression Models HW 12 Slides Lecture   2 Nov Models Anova \u0026amp; Ancova HW 13 Slides Lecture   9 Nov Models Spatial Statistics HW 14 Slides Lecture   16 Nov Flex Flex HW 15 Slides Lecture    ","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"0d09127d49a82b0e72d63da5772d010e","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"This is a 3-credit introductory data course required for all Environmental Studies Students entering our gradaute program.

During this semester you will be introduced to the process of acquiring, manipulation, visualizing, analyzing, and communicating about ecolgoical and geospatial data using the R statistical programming language. As an applied scientist, these will be some of the most important skills that you will develop in graduate school.\nTo begin, you will need to set up your computing environment and dip your toes into R. If you already know a little (or a lot) of R, you can skim the following items. However, if you are new to data analysis in R, you must go through all the material below. I am assuming that you will be able to perform all the operations discussed in the preliminary talks listed below. If not, you will start the class in a deficit—not where we would like to be.\nPrework Lectures  Setting up the R Environment.  This talk will focus on getting you and your computer ready for the semester. There are some applications that you'll need to download and install on your computer *before* we start class. We will also need to install some packages in `R` that have all the data sets and other content that we use in the class so you will be ready.\n   Data Types in R.  This set of talks will focus on the four primary types of data we will use in R: (*numerical*, *character*, *logical*, and *factors* ). In these activities you will gain a basic understanding of how to initiate, coerce, convert, and perform basic operations with each type of data in the most common contexts they will be found in this class.\n   Data Containers.  These short talks will cover three of the more commonly used data containers in `R`: `data.frame`, `list`, and `matrix`. Here we will cover how to create these structures *de novo* as well as load content from files, the internet, or a database.\n  ","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"8459f0ba40272f7706cf99e46010a93b","permalink":"/prework/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/prework/","section":"","summary":"Enviroinmental Data Literacy is the first course in a sequence of classes for graduate students (and in some cases upper-level undergradaute students) in Environmental Studies, Ecology, and Evolution at Virginia Commonwealth University.","tags":null,"title":"Course Preparations","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
